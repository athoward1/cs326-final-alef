4. Innovative Idea
    A website that allows people to make planning spaces, basically some visualized 2D space. The spaces would each have a goal: food to eat, things to do, people to invite, and presents to give. You can invite other people to contribute (e.g. invite all but the present-receiver, or just the adults, or just the hosts, or just one other person). Many ways to layout the spaces but big graphs with terminal/nonterminal ideas and potential subgraphs for them. Multiple people would be working on it at the same time, which would act as a planning station or idea maps. Similar to a Google Doc, but graphical and focused on a goal with potential components.
5. Important Components
    MakeGrid() Function- This function will be the backbone of the entire project given the layout of the webpage.
    Live collaboration- The main motivation of this project is collaboration within a given workspace between team members at the same time 
    Hash Authentication: Given the core motivation of the project, security is key, so we will try and implement a system to verify a usersâ€™ status to give each planning space a hierarchical user system. 
    Pleasant visuals- Since another main component of the project is creating graphs for the user to see it will be important to create a UI system that is complex but easy to understand.  
    Editing cells- Another important component of this project will be the handling  of making and editing cells within the workspace
    Save state- This will save the state of the workspace
    Load state- Will do the opposite of save state
